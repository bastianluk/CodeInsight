# Pull request efficiency and changes page

This page shows you a scatter chart of changes and efficiency. Efficiency computation is explained in [this page](https://github.com/starychfojtu/CodeInsight/blob/master/docs/pr-stats-index.md).
It is useful to identify, what is the optimal size of pull request, as with more changes, the efficiency usually goes down.
