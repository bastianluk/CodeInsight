# Commit frequency page

One of the page's statistics can be configured by custom date range. Every commit contributes to the day it was made by its existance (the statistic counts the number of them).

### Number of Commits on Selected Interval
The configurable graph - this chart shows you the number of commits made per day on the selected interval - this can help you identify days where there is less work done presumably because there is less staff present or because of other reasons you find during the following investigation.

### All Time Numbers of Commits
This chart shows you the number of commits made per day on the interval between now and the day the first commit was made - this provides a bird's-eye view of the statistic shown in the first graph and may help in spotting unwanted trends.

This can help you identify a weak point within your team.
